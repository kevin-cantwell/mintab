For people who tend to open the same document over and over and want to avoid polluting their Chrome tabs with a bunch of duplicates. This extension listens for the tabs.onCreated event and if the pendingUrl matches anything already open, it will navigate to the open tab instead of creating a new one. It is strict! If the url params are out of order or the URI fragment is different it will not notice a match and you'll end up with two tabs with very similar, but not exactly the same, URLs. Furthermore, directly editing an already open tab has no effect. Only tabs created from clicking a link or other similar action will be noticed. This means if you hit âŒ˜-T and paste a url, you can still get dupes! This is important because it represents a workaround if you actually want to force a duplicate for some reason.

Lastly, URLs that start with "chrome://" are ignored. This is because empty tabs actually have a URL ("chrome://newtab/") and I didn't want to interfere with Chrome features.
